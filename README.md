# FAIR Data- Exercise

## Canadian Principal Crops dataset.

The original dataset and detailed description can be found [here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210035901). However, for the purpose of this exercise, the cleaned and subsetted version provided by the Skills Network Labs available [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-RP0203EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Practice%20Assignment/Annual_Crop_Data.csv) was used to read the data in for analysis.

In the original dataset, there are four types of crops (Barley, Canola, Rye and Wheat). This was further subsetted to contain only Barley for three years (1965 - 1967).

## Column description

- YEAR: Date (YYYY/mm/dd)
- CROP_TYPE: Type of crop 
- GEO: Geography
- SEEDED_AREA: Seeded area in acres
- HARVESTED_AREA: Harvested area in acres
- PRODUCTION: Production in bushels
- AVG_YIELD: Average yield in bushels per acre

## Result

The result showed that there was an increase in the average yield of barley from 1965 to 1966, which later declined in 1967. Overall, Alberta had the highest average yield of barley for the three years.
